Whirled Maker SDK
-----------------

Howdy and thanks for giving our SDK a whirl! To get started you'll need to
install the Ant build tool. Take a look at our wiki page for instructions on
how to do that:

Then you have to decide what you'd like to make. You can make an Avatar, a
Game, a Pet or a piece of "smart" Furniture. To create a skeleton project for
each of this, just run the appropriate command:

  ant newavatar
  ant newgame
  ant newpet
  ant newfurni

Be sure also to check out the tutorials on our wiki that explain things in more
detail:
